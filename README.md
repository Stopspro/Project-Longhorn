# atomOS
The perfect operating system, designed to give you a blast of positive energy.

atomOS is a lightweight, 64 bit, terminal OS thats perfect for everyone from developers to gamers to just the average PC user. atOS natively supports most common programming languages (WIP), so coding on it will be a breeze. And as for gamers, using `particle`, atom's package manager (WIP), you'll be sure to find a wealth of games that you'll want to stay up all night to play. 

atomOS is desgined to be flexible; since its coded in Rust and its open-source (obviously, you are on GitHub after all), you can change any part of atom to meet your needs.
