 # impOS
The little devil of a operating system you never knew existed.

impOS is a lightweight, 64 bit, terminal OS thats perfect for everyone from developers to gamers to just the average PC user. impOS natively supports the rusted-runtime, so you can run all of your coding files without a sweat. And as for gamers, using `lava`, imp's package manager (WIP), you'll be sure to find a wealth of games that you'll want to stay up all night to play. 

impOS is desgined to be flexible; since its coded in Rust and its open-source (obviously, you are on GitHub after all), you can change any part of imp to meet your needs.
