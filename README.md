# atomOS
The perfect operating system, designed to give you a blast of positive energy.

atomOS is a lightweight, 64 bit, terminal OS thats perfect for everyone from developers to gamers to just the average PC user. atOS natively supports most common programming languages (WIP), so coding on it will be a breeze. And as for gamers, using `particle`, atom's package manager (WIP), you'll be sure to find a wealth of games that you'll want to stay up all night to play. 

atomOS is desgined to be flexible; since its coded in Rust and its open-source (obviously, you are on GitHub after all), you can change any part of atom to meet your needs.

# on the topic of docs...
As developers, we know what it feels like when you find a neat project and it doesn't have any docs explaining how it works. We hate that feeling, so we are trying to ensure that atomOS has plenty of docs on it. They can be found in just about every single source code file, so that if you are trying to make a fork, you'll know what everything does, making it easier for you.

# current packages:
Core Packages:
 - ion, a shell. Comes with a standard shell and a set of commands.
 - neutron, a server distrobution. Control your workers or servers with ease.
 - electron, a desktop. Not (near) as lightweight as ion + atom, but still pretty small.
 
Extra Packages:
 - molecule, the smallest (and the best) text editor on the face of the Earth. Supposed to be a GNU Nano clone.
 - unicorn, a CPU emulator, used to test and run Assembly code.
 - chess, a game of chess for your terminal.
 
# atom is made with help from you

Please send me a message listing why you would like to help with atomOS, and then, if you get accepted (which you likely will), you'll get your own atomdev...@gmail.com! Nice!
