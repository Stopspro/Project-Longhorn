To build Longhorn, you must have all of the needed programs installed. These tools are:

 - The latest version of NASM (WARNING: THE COMMAND NEEDED TO BUILD A .bin FILE IS *NIX ONLY. WINDOWS USERS MUST EITHER DUAL BOOT, USE A SEOEREATE MACHINE OR RUN A VM.)
 - Cargo, Rust's package manager
 - Xargo
 - A terminal capable of running the command `make` (Windows users, use win-bash)
 - The G++ compiler (See here: https://www.cprogramming.com/g++.html )
 
A batch or shell compatible terminal is recommneded.
