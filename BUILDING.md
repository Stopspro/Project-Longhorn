To build Longhorn, you must have all of the needed programs installed. These tools are:

 - The latest version of NASM (WARNING: The command needed to build the .bin file requires a 64-bit version of Linux. If you don't have that, consider dual-booting or downloading a prebuilt ISO from our site.)
 - Cargo, Rust's package manager
 - Xargo
 - A terminal capable of running the command `make` (Windows users, use win-bash)
 - Git Bash
 
A batch or shell compatible terminal is recommneded.
