# so you want to be a developer...
So, you want to be an atomOS developer? If so, you will be expected to have the following things:

 - A PC (obviously)
 - A good text editor (see below)
 - Discord
 - Slack
 - A screen recorder (for documenting errors)
 - Patience
 
You will also be expected to have read the Code of Conduct.

# Patreon
If you don't want to become a developer, you can become a Patreon (coming soon!). More details to come.

# Text Editors
All programmers should have a good text editor. Personally, I, Hydra, use GNU Nano. Other good text editors include:

- Vim
- Sublime Text
- Emacs
- Spacemacs, a mod of Emacs
- Or be a true atomOS dev and use our very own molecule, an advanced Vim/rasa clone written in Rust.

# Current `Devs`:
 - Hydra (atomdevhydra@gmail.com), Project Founder, lead programmer
 - Stopspro (atomdevstopspro@gmail.com), Website Developer
